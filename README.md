# TLC-RL
Training a Traffic Signal Controlling Agent by Reinforcement Learning method with Lienar Function Approximation
Simulation tool: SUMO
Python 2.7
- TD.py: Take action (phase index) and update the linear weight every 10 seconds.
- RL.py: When phase is changed, agent starts to take action (change phase again or extend the phase) after the mininmum green time.
